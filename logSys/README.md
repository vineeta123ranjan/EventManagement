Instructions
============

The **[Blog Post](http://subinsb.com/php-logsys)** contains the entire information on how to install and use logSys.

In case of GitHub repo, the following folders contain examples of usage
* example-basic
* example-two-step-login

PHP's mail() function is used to send emails. Most likely, emails sent through it will reach the SPAM folder. To avoid this, add an email function in `config` -> `basic` -> `email_callback`.

I recommend to use [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/) (SMTP) or [Mailgun API](https://mailgun.com) to send emails.

Versions
========

## 0.6

**Requires PHP 5.5** - If you want to use it in an older PHP version, get the **password.php** file from [here](https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat/blob/master/lib/password.php) and include it before loading `class.logsys.php` file.

This version changes the algorithm used to hash passwords. If you're using an old version of logSys, you **cannoot** upgrade without resetting the existing passwords in your database.

### Upgrade

* (For upgrading from old versions) Remove all existing values in `password` column in your table
* Remove `password_salt` column from your users' table and set the length of the `password` column to `255`.
* Update "class.logsys.php" file
